# Matrix Product State 
Matrix product state, also referred to as Tensor Train in the field of physics, offers a method to represent an N-dimensional tensor by decomposing it into a product of smaller dimensional tensors. This representation involves factorizing a tensor with N indices into a series of interconnected three-index tensors, forming a chain-like structure. The following image represents an MPS of a 6-dimensional tensor.
